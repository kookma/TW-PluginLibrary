Todolist gives you the confidence that everything’s organized and accounted for, so you can make progress on the things that are important to you.\n\nYou can also make to-dos for major tasks like a project, a work assignment or an overall goal. Therefore, the overall purpose of creating a to-do is to remember tasks and prioritize them.\n\n//Interstitial journaling// is a productivity technique created by Tony Stubblebine. It’s the simplest way to combine note-taking, tasks, and time tracking in one unique workflow (See [[NessLabs|https://nesslabs.com/interstitial-journaling]]).\n\n;Code and demo\nFor learning plugin features, syntax, tutorial and examples see the plugin demo and code pages\n\n* Demo: https://kookma.github.io/TW-Todolist/\n* Code: https://github.com/kookma/TW-Todolist\n",
