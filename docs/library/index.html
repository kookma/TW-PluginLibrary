It adds a button to page controls, on click, creates a tiddler tagged with `solution`, contains `keywords`, `responder`, and `url` fields. It then uses a view template to show the `responder` (author), reference post (`url`), and the `keywords` in a semantic way.\n\nThe `keywords` field acts like tags, so, clicking on them shows a list of all tiddlers tagged with this keyword or has this keyword in its `keywords` field.\n\n; Code and demo\nFor learning plugin features, syntax, tutorial and examples see the plugin demo and code pages\n\n* Demo: https://kookma.github.io/TW-Solution/\n* Code: https://github.com/kookma/TW-Solution\n",
